* random-svm.ipynb is our main approach that yields the highest accuracy, and is also the method we submitted in kaggle. It uses a stack combination of random tree and SVM classifier.  
* stack-three-models.ipynb has the second highest accuracy, which stack combined three approaches, random tree, SVM and perceptron.  
* probability.ipynb is our baseline approach. It uses the simple method of calculating the probability of the next word for both human and machine trainng set, and check if it more probable as machine or human.  
* All three codes can be run directly as long as the files are in the same directory.
